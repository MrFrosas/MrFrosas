# Hey there👋
Welcome to my page! I am MrFrosas, a student addicted to new technologies from Nantes, France.

I also play video games and travel a lot to discover new horizons ;)

*Oh and I sometimes write things on my blog! 📝*

### **🪄 Projects**
Many of my projects are ongoing or private, meanwhile my favorite projects are: 
- Cloud Computing, Release date: ~2024
* Founder of CCGAME, Video game communication website

### **🖱️Skills & Tools**
I'm still learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and graphic design, these are my favorite things at the moment.
I love to discover, learn and design new projects along the way.
